# GENS 1.0

## Initial Update

#### Brief description:

Gens plans to add pods of human and human like people in order to make you feel less alone in this imense world, and more diverse than just villagers. These people will most of the time stay near their spawn points (going back to it if too far, may it be a small caravan, or a campfire) and can interact with the player, in good or bad ways.

### Types of pods and camps:

- Spawn in desert biomes.
- Camp is composed of a campfire in the center, with multiples tents around it (3 to 5).

    - Doesn't do anything apart wandering the camp.
    - Can't attack. Will flee if attacked.
  - Har dealer (merchant):
    - Can buy (first slot, if the merchant wants to buy two things, the prices are reduced by half in both slots, for example, 4 iron ingots and 8 lapis instead of 8 iron ingots):

  - Sentinel:
    - Guards the campement, wields a scimitar variant, always poisonned by a random sma type.
    - Attacks any hostile mob that comes in range.
    - Attacks any entity that damages one of the people of the tribe.

    - Will gather any dropped items.



#### Items:

- Scimitar: 
  - Shorter range than iron sword (~1 block less).
  - 6 attack damage,1.6 attack speed, 251 durability.
  - Can be repaired in an anvil with iron ingots like an iron sword.
  - When sma is applied on a scimitar, the sma efficiency is doubled (example, if the Sma is Zil, provokes Wither II instead of Wither I).
  - Can only be obtained from trading with the Har dealers
- Sma bottle:
  - The sma is a powerful poison brewed by Har people after ancestral recipes. A sma bottle can be applied on any weapon (vanilla swords and axes for example) by putting it in a crafting slot along the desired weapon to be poisonned.
  - When applied on a weapon, has a limited number of charges (hitting one ennemy will consume one charge).
  - The maximum charge amount is the durability left on the weapon.
  - Applying one sma bottle will offer the weapon 30 charges.
  - You can only apply one type of sma on a blade.
  - Right clicking with a poisonned weapon in hand on a filled cauldron will clear all charges of the weapon.
  - When a sma bottle is used, it leaves an empty bottle after the craft.
  - Sma bottles can be drunk, resulting in the effects being applied to the drinker and amplified (x2, Wither I -> Wither II, don't do that).
