# GENS 1.0

## Initial Update

#### Brief description:

Gens plans to add pods of human and human like people in order to make you feel less alone in this imense world, and more diverse than just villagers. These people will most of the time stay near their spawn points (going back to it if too far, may it be a small caravan, or a campfire) and can interact with the player, in good or bad ways.
